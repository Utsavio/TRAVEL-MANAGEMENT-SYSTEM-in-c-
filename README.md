The objective of the Tourist Reservation System is to develop a software application that facilitates the efficient management of trip bookings and reservations for tourists. The system aims to provide a user-friendly interface for both administrators and users, allowing them to perform various tasks such as adding new trips, displaying trip details, making reservations, searching for reservations, and cancelling reservations. By automating these processes, the system seeks to streamline the overall booking and reservation workflow, thereby enhancing the experience of tourists and improving the efficiency of tourism management.
Developed using C++, the system offers separate functionalities for administrators and users, providing a comprehensive platform for trip management and reservation handling.
